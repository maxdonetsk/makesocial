            <p><strong>Our absolute strength is back-end web development and programming.</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What are we best at?</strong></p>
            <p>If we have absolute freedom, we go with <strong>PHP, </strong>specifically <strong>Yii</strong> framework every time.</p>
            <p>If required, we also have back-end libraries to support your application requirements. Every solution is different and we make sure the technology stack fits just right.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Cloud all-around</strong></p>
            <p>We are entirely cloud oriented. We understand <strong>AWS</strong> inside out and use the whole spectrum of its services: from Route53 and CloudFront, to proper load balancing and auto-scaling EC2 instances and RDS instances, all the way through to proper deployment via Elastic Beanstalk and OpsWorks.</p>
