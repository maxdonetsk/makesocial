            <p><strong>Our absolute strength is back-end web development and programming.</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased">We have various departments dedicated to specific technology stacks: Python/PostgreSQL, node.js/Mongo, PHP/MySQL, Ruby/Titan, etc. Every one of these stacks can be utilized to the best of its ability on AWS or Azure by using the latest in cloud computing.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What are we best at?</strong></p>
            <p>If we have absolute freedom, we go with <strong>Python, </strong>specifically <strong>django</strong> framework every time. PYTEX originally started as a python development team, however grew into a diverse group of specialists with python still at the core of its group.</p>
            <p>Our second choice is usually either ROR (Ruby on Rails) or one of the stronger PHP frameworks (Yii, Laravel or Symfony2). We also have a small team specializing in node.js (express and loopback) development.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>API-centric Architecture</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>API: Node.js (ExpressJS, Loopback, MongoDB, SwaggerUI)</strong></p>
            <p>API is what glues your front-end views with the back-end data and logic. The technologies we use can support billions of simultaneous connections with the right hardware behind them (usually AWS).</p>
            <p>If required, we also have PHP(Yii) and Python(django) back-end libraries to support your application requirements. Every solution is different and we make sure the technology stack fits just right.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Cloud all-around</strong></p>
            <p>We are entirely cloud oriented. We understand <strong>AWS</strong> inside out and use the whole spectrum of its services: from Route53 and CloudFront, to proper load balancing and auto-scaling EC2 instances and RDS instances, all the way through to proper deployment via Elastic Beanstalk and OpsWorks.</p>
