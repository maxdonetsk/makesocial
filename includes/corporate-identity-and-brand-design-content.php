            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>The way your brand is perceived is essential to your business.</strong></p>
            <p>You have spent way too much time developing your company, defining your needs and values to flush it all down the toilet with mediocre design that is templated, old-fashioned and dull. Or even stolen!</p>
            <p><strong>Every bit of contact that you have with the public, whether they are your customers, stakeholders or just interested parties is marketing.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your message is important!</li>
                <li>Your logo is important!</li>
                <li>Your website is important!</li>
                <li>Your stationery is important!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Design is not just a pretty face, but rather the core, the DNA, of a brand.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>So what do we do? We ask the right questions:</strong></p>
            <p>
                What drives customers to your brand? <br/>
                What makes them buy from you or use your product? <br/>
                What do they like about doing business with you?
            </p>
            <p>At EtonDigital we believe that successful brand design is about promoting business strengths and all of the above questions help us to develop the look, feel and messages behind your corporate identity so that we can start to build and communicate your brand.</p>

            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Delivery phases</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>1. Research</strong></p>
            <p>Information gathering phase. We research the market and competitive landscape, analyse your goals and objectives that will guide us through an effective campaign to deliver design and content.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>2. Creating and conceptualization</strong></p>
            <p>Critical thinking phase. We assemble the gathered data, learn from it and develop a conceptual, strategised approach. The conceptualization and sketching will be based upon your strengths and unique selling points. This is a phase where we explore the right colour, type treatment, look and feel of the design.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>3. Presentation</strong></p>
            <p>Designs will be presented in a mockup form for your review. We then discuss the feedback and this helps us provide a better sense of what the designs will look like in real life application or as part of a cohesive brand.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>4. Revisions</strong></p>
            <p>Upon your feedback, any necessary changes to the presented designs will be addressed (i.e. color, type, graphic modification).</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>5. Finalization</strong></p>
            <p>When you are completely satisfied, designs are the finalised and delivered for print production, media outputs, online integration or media presentation, as needed.</p>
