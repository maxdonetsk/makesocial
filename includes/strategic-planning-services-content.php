            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored">There is an old quote by Benjamin Franklin that says: <strong>“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."</strong></p>
            <p>We stand 100% behind that quote and we consider it a privilege to help you implement and merge your initial concept with everything our team knows about social networks, mobile, startups; about what does and doesn't work.</p>
            <p>Our team has experience working with small businesses and large corporations on a variety of projects. From basic to advanced requirements, we can provide the appropriate service to meet your needs.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong>It's included.</strong><br/>
                Our job is not just to complete a project, we are here for you to help you realise your vision. We will ask the right questions, discuss your business model, target market and strategic techniques; perhaps challenge your whole idea and then build together a safe and doable strategy that will help you earn a strongly-defined space in the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>It is also available as a separate service.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What does it look like?</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>We go through your business model or help you create one.</li>
                <li>We assemble all necessary information into an architecture, which can be a prototype or a wireframe</li>
                <li>We discuss it together, gather feedback and finalise the strategy</li>
                <li>We guide you through the process: investors, partners, work organisation, employees…</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With us you get way more than design and development. We have the experience, creativity and business savvy that you need to make your brand and product a success.</p>
