            <p><strong>Ecommerce by itself is simple. We've done it for over a decade.</strong> Ecommerce development in a mix of other technologies and within a social set of features, or an elearning product, is a whole new dimention.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased">We have a whole department dedicated to ecommerce development which tightly integrates with our various teams. We have integrated with everything form Authorize.net to stripe and recurly. We use bitcoin wallets and exchanges and know exatcly what it takes to do business on the web today!</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What we understand about ecommerce development:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>SSLs and Encryption.</strong> We understand the whole process from registration and configuration of SSL certificates, all the way through the development process of secure ecommerce features.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment Gateway Integration,</strong> like Authorize.net, Shopify, PayPal, and many others.</p>
            <p><strong>Merchant Accounts,</strong> how they work, usual processes, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Stripe API Integration</strong> has been one of our favorites lately, which allows payments over bitcoin.</p>
            <p><strong>Yes, speaking of Bitcoin</strong>, we have integrated with a multitude of exchanges and wallets and even have written our own.</p>
            <p><strong>Magento</strong> deserves a bullet-point of its own when it comes to Ecommerce Development and has been our choice for development of standalone systems. We even have original team members from the founding team of Magento in Kharkiv, Ukraine.</p>
