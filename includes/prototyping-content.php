            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Why is prototyping important?</strong></p>
            <p>In theory, everything works fine, in practice, it doesn't. Without a prototype, we can't test your product until we've built it, and in today's business environment, to build a product before you've tested it is insane.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>How do we solve this problem effectively?</strong></p>
            <p>Your requirements may change drastically during the building process. To solve that we create wireframes and clickable prototypes to illustrate the features that will be placed on a page to visualise how all interface elements will work together. Our goal is to test them, learn from them, model the product while it is still young, and continue to test it throughout the process until we are completely satisfied with the outcome.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>The Prototyping Process</strong></p>
            <p>Prototyping is a set of activities during a three step process:</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>1. Discovery Phase</strong></p>
            <p>A discovery phase can define all functionalities. We can provide a detailed information architecture which outlines user journeys and build wireframes that can later become clickable prototypes. If you are building a start-up and you need to attract investors, this is the MVP you will need for a pitch.</p>
            <p>Every discovery phase is different. A simple wireframe may be enough for some projects, a full design for a selected number of pages may be needed for others to create the right clickable prototype.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>2. Review Phase</strong></p>
            <p>In this phase we present the prototype to you and we evaluate together whether the needs and expectations are met. This phase is crucial for determining what stays and what goes.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>3. Refinement Phase</strong></p>
            <p>This is the part where we gather feedback, identify areas that need to be perfected, or further defined and clarified, and continue modeling the product.</p>
            <p>They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. By creating a prototype we discuss the product through visuals instead of words which ensures that everyone shares a common understanding, and it reduces risk and avoids missed requirements, leading to a better design faster.</p>
            <p>That is why we build prototypes.</p>
