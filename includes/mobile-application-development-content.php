            <p>Most of our front-end developers use <strong>AngularJS</strong>, aside from your usual HTML5, CSS3, and SCSS and/or SASS. AngularJS is by far the very best front-end framework for web application development and we have professionals who live and breathe Angular.</p>
            <p>Applications built with AngularJS save bandwidth as only data is being transferred, without the heavy wrappers around it. Separation of front-end and back-end logic results in maximum efficiency of hardware resources. AngularJS lets us extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.</p>
            <p>Youtube, Vevo, MSNBC are just a few of the names heavily relying on AngularJS to provide quality services to their users.</p>

            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>PhoneGap or Titanium Appcelerator</strong></p>
            <p>By using PhoneGap or Titanium Appcelerator we can easily deploy to many environments all at once, from the single codebase. Building applications for each device–iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile and more–requires different frameworks and languages. PhoneGap solves this by using standards-based web technologies to bridge web applications and mobile devices. Since PhoneGap apps are standards compliant, they’re future-proofed to work with browsers as they evolve.</p>

            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Native App Development</strong></p>
            <p>Although we prefer PhoneGap, we sometimes do native application development when it's absolutely imperative to use certain phone features framework development simply doesn't support. It's rare, but it happens.</p>
            <p>Building native applications means using the native language of the platform, SWIFT or Objective-C on iOS, and Java on Android. Native apps are compiled into machine code (Dalvik byte code under Android), which gives the best performance you can get from the mobile phone. The only disatvantage her is cost.</p>
