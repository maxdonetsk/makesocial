                    <p class="tm-default-p">Procurious approached EtonDigital to create a global online network and knowledge hub for young procurement professionals with the aim of enticing them to connect, engage and learn, oversee professional awards and networking events, and offer an effective platform to sell and deliver online trainings.</p>
                    <p class="tm-default-p">The core feature of the website is the networking function, which operates in the same way as a LinkedIn style website. Users must be able to message each other and connect with one another, share articles they’ve read, have a profile with contact details and CV, and join groups and other discussion sections.</p>

                    <p class="tm-default-p">Procurious is a complex, powerful platform, but we knew from the start that maintaining a level of simplicity around navigation and functionality would be key to keeping users engaged and for them to easily find their way around from the moment they first landed on the website. Procurious consists of the main Procurious portal available to all registered members and different private member areas which are called Roundtables.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p class="tm-default-p">The biggest challenge was to let users easily switch the portal they are on and still keep the same flow and structure, but with completely different branding for each Roundtable. The userflow maps out how various screens relate to each other and how users navigate between them.</p>

                    <p class="tm-default-p">We explored individual content elements and how they'll come together to form the actual screens users interact with. By creating wireframes first, we got a sense of the user experience and were able to spot potential usability problems early. Since wireframes lack UI style, it’s easier to focus on functionality and place a priority on content, making it easier and quicker to make adjustments at an early stage.</p>
