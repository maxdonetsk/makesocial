We initiate an intensive, one to two weeks, discovery sprint organized to help our team grasp the core components of the business, gain industry specific knowledge, and most importantly understand your technical requirements precisely and completely. Here you work with your PYTEX Business Analyst, Project Manager and a dedicated Software Architect. At some point within this phase, we add the UI expert, UX expert, and your future Lead developer to attend discovery workshops, but all team members can be included as well, if the project requires full involvement of all team members from early discovery sessions. This workshop can be held in our sales offices in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Toronto, London, or Sydney, or our development centers in Lviv, Sambir, Warsaw or Manila.</p>

        <div class="col-md-7">
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Why is prototyping important?</strong></p>
            <p>In theory, everything works fine, in practice, it doesn't. Without a prototype, we can't test your product until we've built it, and in today's business environment, to build a product before you've tested it is insane.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>How do we solve this problem effectively?</strong></p>
            <p>Your requirements may change drastically during the building process. To solve that we create wireframes and clickable prototypes to illustrate the features that will be placed on a page to visualise how all interface elements will work together. Our goal is to test them, learn from them, model the product while it is still young, and continue to test it throughout the process until we are completely satisfied with the outcome.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>The Prototyping Process</strong></p>
            <p>Prototyping is a set of activities during a three step process:</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>1. Discovery Phase</strong></p>
            <p>A discovery phase can define all functionalities. We can provide a detailed information architecture which outlines user journeys and build wireframes that can later become clickable prototypes. If you are building a start-up and you need to attract investors, this is the MVP you will need for a pitch.</p>
            <p>Every discovery phase is different. A simple wireframe may be enough for some projects, a full design for a selected number of pages may be needed for others to create the right clickable prototype.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>2. Review Phase</strong></p>
            <p>In this phase we present the prototype to you and we evaluate together whether the needs and expectations are met. This phase is crucial for determining what stays and what goes.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>3. Refinement Phase</strong></p>
            <p>This is the part where we gather feedback, identify areas that need to be perfected, or further defined and clarified, and continue modeling the product.</p>
            <p>They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. By creating a prototype we discuss the product through visuals instead of words which ensures that everyone shares a common understanding, and it reduces risk and avoids missed requirements, leading to a better design faster.</p>
            <p>That is why we build prototypes.</p>

                <p>
                    What drives customers to your brand? <br/>
                    What makes them buy from you or use your product? <br/>

                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>1. Research</strong></p>
                <p>Information gathering phase. We research the market and competitive landscape, analyse your goals and objectives that will guide us through an effective campaign to deliver design and content.</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>2. Creating and conceptualization</strong></p>
                <p>Critical thinking phase. We assemble the gathered data, learn from it and develop a conceptual, strategised approach. The conceptualization and sketching will be based upon your strengths and unique selling points. This is a phase where we explore the right colour, type treatment, look and feel of the design.</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>3. Presentation</strong></p>
                <p>Designs will be presented in a mockup form for your review. We then discuss the feedback and this helps us provide a better sense of what the designs will look like in real life application or as part of a cohesive brand.</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>4. Revisions</strong></p>
                <p>Upon your feedback, any necessary changes to the presented designs will be addressed (i.e. color, type, graphic modification).</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>5. Finalization</strong></p>
                <p>When you are completely satisfied, designs are the finalised and delivered for print production, media outputs, online integration or media presentation, as needed.</p>

            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Is your goal to turn your visitors into leads?</strong></p>
            <p>Many businesses make the mistake of giving a copywriter's job to a random person. The result is a lot of jargon filled, business oriented text that no one wants to read. We find it baffling.</p>
            <p>People spend a lot of money building and improving their on-line presence and then spoil it all with poor, or mediocre at best, copy.</p>
            <p>We here at Eton Digital take great pride in delivering the whole package: clever strategy, great design and efficient development, and we find that many digital solutions on the web, are not as effective without a good copy.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>So what do we do?</strong></p>
            <p>We save you time: As you have already filled out our questionnaire we have a thorough understanding of what you want, making it easy for us to meet your needs and create effective, appropriate copy for your product.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>
            <p>Whether it is website copy, a description for the App Stores, or a copy for your e-mail campaign we will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Research your target group: What type of tone they like, what questions they want answered</li>
                <li>Write clever copy with a good call to action</li>
                <li>Optimise it correctly</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Why is copywriting important?</strong></p>
            <p>A beautiful website is not enough to convey your message. Being in the top three search results or having a lovely ad is not enough to sell. Many companies have forgotten how important copy is, and have buried themselves in an endless sea of poorly written text. Don't be one of them.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Has copywriting changed?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Yes.<br/>
                Copywriting on the Internet is greatly influenced by what people search for. With Google now rewarding pages that provide excellent user experience, many online businesses have turned to copywriters to make sure their visitors get what they came for. Good copywriters do their homework, they use available tools to check what people are searching for, what they share on their social media and what makes one business more successful than the other. And then they phrase it effectively.

                <p><strong>If you're looking to build the next facebook, or a micro-social network for your industry, we're just the right team for you.</strong></p>
                <p class="tm-increased">We have a whole department dedicated to development of social networking websites and projects which are social in nature. On top of aesthetics, we deem performance as one of the most important and increasingly vital qualities of our projects. By using technologies such as Node.js (Loopback, Express.js), Angular.js, MongoDB, and AWS we ensure your social network is always lightning fast, loading in microseconds and seamlessly delivers the best user experience.</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What do you get?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>A social network</strong> solution that is entirely and genuinely yours: custom look and feel, custom functionality, custom layout, and pretty much everything custom.</p>
                <p><strong>A team,</strong> which not only understands how to design, build and deploy social networks, elearning platforms, marketplaces, and pretty much anything social in nature, but also can help you grow, support, market and even raise VC for your project. We have done it time and time again and now offer a lot more than just technical and project management expertise to our valuable clients.</p>
                <p><strong>Full ownership</strong> of your intellectual property, which you have full control over at every step of the way, every sprint, every iteration, every phase. While it remains yours, we value your IP as we would our own.</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>General Architectural Overview:</strong></p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>AngularJS web front-end and Apps</strong></p>
                <p>Most of our social networks use AngularJS on the front-end, aside from your usual HTML5, CSS3, and SCSS and/or SASS. AngularJS is by far the very best front-end framework for web application development and we have professionals who live and breathe Angular.</p>
                <p>Applications built with AngularJS save bandwidth as only data is being transferred, without the heavy wrappers around it. Separation of front-end and back-end logic results in maximum efficiency of hardware resources.</p>
                <p>Youtube, Vevo, MSNBC are just a few of the names heavily relying on AngularJS to provide quality services to their users.</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>API: Node.js (ExpressJS, Loopback, MongoDB, SwaggerUI)</strong></p>
                <p>API is what glues your front-end views with the back-end data and logic. The technologies we use can support billions of simultaneous connections with the right hardware behind them (usually AWS).</p>
                <p>If required, we also have PHP(Yii) and Python(django) back-end libraries to support your application requirements. Every solution is different and we make sure the technology stack fits just right.</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>AWS</strong></p>
                <p>We are entirely cloud oriented. We understand AWS inside out and use the whole spectrum of its services: from Route53 and CloudFront, to proper load balancing and auto-scaling EC2 instances and RDS instances, all the way through to proper deployment via Elastic Beanstalk and OpsWorks.</p>

            <p class="tm-increased"><strong>Whether your project is a Rich Internet Application, an Intranet Portal, a Corporate Website or a Complex Web Platform you need to stand out among the many generic and poorly-crafted web projects on the Internet today.</strong></p>
            <p>We have been selected by Amazon Web Services, an Amazon.com company, to join their Solution Provider Program and we offer IT professional services related to the expanding set of cloud computing services through Amazon Web Services (AWS), the best of its kind.</p>

            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>We make e-commerce integration easy</strong></p>
            <p>We provide E-commerce Integration with most payment providers and shopping carts – with particular expertise in PayPal, PayPal Pro, HSBC, Protx and WorldPay, and offer features such as Advanced E-commerce integration, recurring and deferred payments, device-compatible, invisible and automated transaction processing.

            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What are the platforms we recommend?</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>Drupal</strong></p>
            <p>Drupal is a popular PHP-based open source Content Management platform. It is typically used for content-rich and community-driven websites, and is capable of supporting some of the largest websites on the internet such as Sony, MTV, the UN, Hillary Clinton, Playstation, Ecademy, Second Life Linden Labs, NATO, NASA and The White House. Drupal CMS has built a reputation of innovation, stability and malleability that is unmatched. Drupal boasts thousands of modules for almost any type of digital presence, with a focus on personalization, community building and social tools. We recommend Drupal because projects created with it tend to be remarkably secure, flexible, maintainable and extensible.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>Symfony</strong></p>
            <p>Developed and maintained by a community of thousands of users and developers, this open-source software is a great option for your web project. Symfony features modern principles and patterns in web development and, as a framework, it is ideal for further in-house development. It runs smoothly on low-cost hostings and can bear the weight of a large system with hundreds of thousands of users and heavy traffic.</p>
            <p>We recommend it for a variety of web sites, social networks, blogs and content management systems. Big names that have recognised Symfony as an excellent solution for their needs are BBC, Dailymotion and TED. Join them.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>WordPress</strong></p>
            <p>For web projects that are not so challenging and complicated, we recommend WordPress. This is an excellent, cost-effective solution that satisfies a lot of requirements and is extremely easy to use. That’s the main reason why WordPress has grown so much in popularity. It's great for simple, content based web projects. Time magazine uses it, but also CNN, and many more.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Who have we worked with?</strong></p>
            <p>Internationally known brands such as <strong>Nissan UK & Ireland, Hyundai Ireland, RICOH, CANAL+, Virgin Media</strong> and many more have trusted us with their projects, and so can you.</p>

                <p>Let's talk tech. What do we recommend?</p>
                <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>There are two types of mobile apps: Native and Hybrid</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Native apps</strong> live on the device and are accessed through icons on the device home screen. They are installed through an app store (such as Google Play or Apple’s App Store). When developed for a specific platform, Android or iOs, they can take full advantage of all the device’s features: camera, GPS, microphone, list of contacts, etc. Native apps can use the device’s notification system and can work offline.</p>
                <p>As an alternative to native mobile apps, we can build hybrid mobile apps which is more cost effective but with slightly lower performance when compared to native apps.</p>
                <p><strong>Hybrid applications</strong> are part native apps, part web apps. They are web applications (or web pages) in the native browser, such as UIWebView or WKWebView in iOS and WebView in Android. Hybrid apps are developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and then wrapped in a native application. Hybrid mobile applications can employ a mobile device's native features. When built well, these apps look and feel like fully native apps but since they depend on the native browser, they are not as fast as native apps.</p>
                <p>The hybrid app development is faster, simpler, more rapid and the application is easier to maintain.</p>

Our goal is for them to find you not only for your "money keywords" but for your brand keywords as well, and this is where gaining links to your site and promoting your brand comes into the equation.</p>
            <p><strong>Sounds easy? It's not.</strong> The major search engines: Google, Yahoo, Bing are constantly changing their algorithm and you can’t manipulate the rankings. You need to go about this the correct way and that is a process, but the results are long term.</p>
            <p><strong>Think of it as an investment into the future.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We want you to succeed and we will do our best to assist you through the journey.</strong></p>
