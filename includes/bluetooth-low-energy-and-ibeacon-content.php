            <p><strong>We love BLE related development and the iBeacon protocol so much, we've dedicated this whole section to it.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Bluetooth Low Energy</strong> is a wireless personal area network technology used for transmitting data over short distances. As the name implies, itâ€™s designed for low energy consumption and cost, while maintaining a communication range similar to that of its predecessor, Classic Bluetooth.</p>
            <p><strong>With iBeacon</strong>, Apple has standardized the format for BLE Advertising. Under this format, an advertising packet consists of four main pieces of information.</p>

            <p><strong>With iBeacon</strong>, you can detect when a user walks near one of your stores and display a message on their iPhone enticing them in. Or, if they have the app running, you can detect which part of your store they are in, and show more information or special offers to the user.</p>

            <p><strong>With PYTEX</strong>, with the help of the iBeacon protocol, your app/service can show specific content when the user is in a particular store/location, and you can let them scan barcodes to pull up more information about your product.</p>
            <p>We've worked on many different iBeacon applications from simple ad serving startups to healthcare and elearning setups.</p>
