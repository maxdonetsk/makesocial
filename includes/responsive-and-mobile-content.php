            <p>Just try resizing our website &mdash; it'll work on anything from a smartwatch to the largest resolution SmartTV you can find. We guarantee it.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Apps are just a few sprints away.</strong></p>
            <p>Because of the API development approach described above, and with the help of PhoneGap, once we have built your web product, we can build your apps in a matter of a few sprints (2 &ndash; 4 weeks), both for iOS and Android, and all the other platforms if you require, even Wii and PS. We build it once, and with a slight adjustment, deploy to all these environments with a click.</p>

            <p>In case framework app development isn't enough and you need some more juice from your users' devices, we can do it also!</p>
