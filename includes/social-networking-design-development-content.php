            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Platforms we recommend:</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>Symfony</strong></p>
            <p>Symfony is an open-source software, maintained and developed by a community of thousands of users and developers. Updates are released regularly to ensure clean code, robust functionality and updated security.</p>
            <p>Symfony adopts and features the most modern principles and patterns in Web development and is capable of running fast on low-cost hostings as well as bearing the weight of a large system with hundreds of thousands of users and heavy traffic. As a framework, it is ideal for further in-house development.</p>
            <p>We recommend it for a variety of web sites, social networks, blogs and content management systems. Big names that have recognised Symfony as an excellent solution for their needs are BBC, Dailymotion and TED. Join them.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>AngularJS</strong></p>
            <p>AngularJS is a very popular framework with a large community, fast growing and supported by Google. It supports Single Page Applications and embraces both Test Driven Development and Behaviour Driven Development.</p>
            <p>Applications which are built with AngularJS save bandwidth as only data is being transferred, without extra wrappers around. This also results in websites having RESTful API which can later be used for third party integrations or for your mobile application. Separation of concerns is at the highest level - besides data storage and services, API and presentation layers are now separated as well. Youtube, Vevo, MSNBC are only some of the names that have relied on AngularJS to provide quality to their users.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>Drupal</strong></p>
            <p>Drupal is a popular PHP-based open source Content Management platform which is typically used for community-driven websites. Some of the largest websites on the internet such as Sony, MTV, the UN, Playstation, Ecademy, Second Life Linden Labs, NATO, NASA and The White House are built on Drupal. Projects created with Drupal tend to be flexible, maintainable and extensible. We recommend Drupal because it offers thousands of modules for almost any type of digital presence, with a focus on personalization, community building and social tools. It's simply amazing.</p>
