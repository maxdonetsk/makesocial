            <p><strong>If you're looking to build the next facebook, or a micro-social network for your industry, we're just the right team for you.</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased">We have a whole department dedicated to development of social networking websites and projects which are social in nature. On top of aesthetics, we deem performance as one of the most important and increasingly vital qualities of our projects. By using technologies such as Node.js (Loopback, Express.js), Angular.js, MongoDB, and AWS we ensure your social network is always lightning fast, loading in microseconds and seamlessly delivers the best user experience.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What do you get?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A social network</strong> solution that is entirely and genuinely yours: custom look and feel, custom functionality, custom layout, and pretty much everything custom.</p>
            <p><strong>A team,</strong> which not only understands how to design, build and deploy social networks, elearning platforms, marketplaces, and pretty much anything social in nature, but also can help you grow, support, market and even raise VC for your project. We have done it time and time again and now offer a lot more than just technical and project management expertise to our valuable clients.</p>
            <p><strong>Full ownership</strong> of your intellectual property, which you have full control over at every step of the way, every sprint, every iteration, every phase. While it remains yours, we value your IP as we would our own.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>General Architectural Overview:</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>AngularJS web front-end and Apps</strong></p>
            <p>Most of our social networks use AngularJS on the front-end, aside from your usual HTML5, CSS3, and SCSS and/or SASS. AngularJS is by far the very best front-end framework for web application development and we have professionals who live and breathe Angular.</p>
            <p>Applications built with AngularJS save bandwidth as only data is being transferred, without the heavy wrappers around it. Separation of front-end and back-end logic results in maximum efficiency of hardware resources.</p>
            <p>Youtube, Vevo, MSNBC are just a few of the names heavily relying on AngularJS to provide quality services to their users.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>API: Node.js (ExpressJS, Loopback, MongoDB, SwaggerUI)</strong></p>
            <p>API is what glues your front-end views with the back-end data and logic. The technologies we use can support billions of simultaneous connections with the right hardware behind them (usually AWS).</p>
            <p>If required, we also have PHP(Yii) and Python(django) back-end libraries to support your application requirements. Every solution is different and we make sure the technology stack fits just right.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>AWS</strong></p>
            <p>We are entirely cloud oriented. We understand AWS inside out and use the whole spectrum of its services: from Route53 and CloudFront, to proper load balancing and auto-scaling EC2 instances and RDS instances, all the way through to proper deployment via Elastic Beanstalk and OpsWorks.</p>
