            <p>Many businesses make the mistake of giving a copywriter's job to a random person. People spend a lot of money building and improving their online presence and then spoil it all with poor copy. We here at PYTEX take great pride in delivering the whole package: clever strategy, great design and efficient development, and we find that many digital solutions on the web lack good copy.</p>
