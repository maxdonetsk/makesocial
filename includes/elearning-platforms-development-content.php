            <p><strong>If you're looking to build an elearning platform, or a social network with an LMS twist, we're just the right team for you.</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased">We have a whole department dedicated to development of elearning systems and projects which are education related. On top of our custom LMS development experience, we have heavily customized Moodle, Schoology, and Sakai.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Our Elearning Expertise</strong></p>
            <p>We always recommend a custom LMS solution, however here are our favorites in the world of open source:</p>
            <p><strong>Moodle</strong> is the gorilla in the room of open source LMSs. Moodle is primarily aimed at the education market, but is also used by plenty of corporations for eLearning and training purposes, including big guys like Cisco and Subaru.</p>
            <p><strong>Schoology</strong> is a freemium LMS aimed primarily at educators (similar to Blackboard’s CourseSites). It’s web-based and the Basic Package is free for instructors, with the option to upgrade to an Enterprise Package if you want specialized support or integration with your school’s SIS platform. Schoology does not share the prices for the Enterprise Package on its website.</p>
            <p><strong>Sakai</strong> is another open source solution we love. Sakai differs from Moodle and Schoology in a few key elements. It is built on Java, as opposed to LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) and while it is open source, only certain key stakeholders and commercial affiliates are allowed to contribute to the source code. We have such access to the core team and would love to help you with your sakai development needs.</p>
