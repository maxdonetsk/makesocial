            <p><strong>A strong business requires a strong foundation.</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased">To us that foundation consists of a solid ERP system (or at least CRM integration at a startup level). We are proud to say we have the right expertise to help you with your most complex ERP needs, or simple CRM customization at a very basic salesforce level. Unlike our competition, we are not going to educate you on the terms and their meaning. Rather, here's a list of our absolute favorites when it comes to ERP and CRM work we've done for our clients/partners:</p>
            <p><strong>Odoo ERP</strong>, formerly OpenERP is our absolute favorite. Since the core of our business used to be Python and PostgreSQL, it's natural that we have a solid team to support the technology side of our odoo consulting business. We also have a strong business team which uses odoo daily, internally, and within our client accounts.</p>
            <p>We believe in odoo wholeheartedly. This is why we have made it our mission to build the strongest odoo implementation team in the World. So far, we can honestly say we have the strongest Odoo team in Ukraine, which is growing evey month.</p>
            <p><strong>SugarCRM</strong> is the easiest to staff for in our development centers. Some of us have worked with it for over a decade, so it's still a natural for us.</p>
            <p><strong>vTiger</strong> is another option whenever we discuss ERP/CRM needs with our clients. Since it's also PHP based, we have a lot of team members who can do wonders with vTiger on the technology side.</p>
