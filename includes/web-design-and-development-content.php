            <p class="tm-increased">Whether your project is a Rich Internet Application, an Intranet Portal, a Corporate Website or a Complex Web Platform, you need to follow the latest software development practices. <strong>Well, you don't &mdash; we do. We do it for you.</strong></p>
            <p>We have over a decade of experience in programming, which is actually our core business. We have experts at AngularJS, HTML, CSS, SASS, PHP, Python, node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and AWS.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>API Development Approach</strong></p>
            <p>Unless requested otherwise, we architect most of our web solutions with an API at the core, using node.js (express and loopback) or PHP (usually Yii) with MySQL and Mongo for databases. All this works with AngularJS clients across a variety of platforms and operating systems. Unless requested otherwise, we setup a solid AWS infrastructure for your product (CloudFront, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Auto-Scaling, Elastic Beanstalk, OpsWorks).</p>
