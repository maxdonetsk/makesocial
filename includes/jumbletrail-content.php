        <p>Ever wanted to take part or just visit a local jumble or car boot sale but struggled to find one near you or even just find one anywhere? Then we suggest you jump on board the Jumble Trail, a website helping communities come together to set up stalls outside their houses to sell bric-a-brac, toys, vintage clothes, cakes or anything at all.</p>

                    <p class="tm-default-p">Jumble Trail is the brainchild of Martina Randles who has always found delight in bargain hunting and repurposing other people's pre-loved clothes and accessories. She set up her first jumble sale in 2013 as a way of bringing something to the community she was living in and soon discovered that it was a great opportunity to spend time with people in the neighborhood, find hidden treasures and make a little money.</p>
                    <p class="tm-default-p">This jumble sale was actually the starting point for jumble trailâ€™s website, which came out of the need to make the whole process easier - so that anyone can start jumble trail and spread the word, or just find a jumble in their neighborhood and join to sell their things. As people register online a map is created to show who's selling what, where their stall is, and even post pictures of their wares.</p>
