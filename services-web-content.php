            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>What are the platforms we recommend?</strong></p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>Drupal</strong></p>
            <p>Drupal is a popular PHP-based open source Content Management platform. It is typically used for content-rich and community-driven websites, and is capable of supporting some of the largest websites on the internet such as Sony, MTV, the UN, Hillary Clinton, Playstation, Ecademy, Second Life Linden Labs, NATO, NASA and The White House. Drupal CMS has built a reputation of innovation, stability and malleability that is unmatched. Drupal boasts thousands of modules for almost any type of digital presence, with a focus on personalization, community building and social tools. We recommend Drupal because projects created with it tend to be remarkably secure, flexible, maintainable and extensible.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>Symfony</strong></p>
            <p>Developed and maintained by a community of thousands of users and developers, this open-source software is a great option for your web project. Symfony features modern principles and patterns in web development and, as a framework, it is ideal for further in-house development. It runs smoothly on low-cost hostings and can bear the weight of a large system with hundreds of thousands of users and heavy traffic.</p>
            <p>We recommend it for a variety of web sites, social networks, blogs and content management systems. Big names that have recognised Symfony as an excellent solution for their needs are BBC, Dailymotion and TED. Join them.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-margin-less"><strong>WordPress</strong></p>
            <p>For web projects that are not so challenging and complicated, we recommend WordPress. This is an excellent, cost-effective solution that satisfies a lot of requirements and is extremely easy to use. That’s the main reason why WordPress has grown so much in popularity. It's great for simple, content based web projects. Time magazine uses it, but also CNN, and many more.</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>Who have we worked with?</strong></p>
            <p>Internationally known brands such as <strong>Nissan UK & Ireland, Hyundai Ireland, RICOH, CANAL+, Virgin Media</strong> and many more have trusted us with their projects, and so can you.</p>
