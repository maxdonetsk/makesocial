            <p class="tm-default-p tm-margin-01">In short: The first step is to have all requirements clearly defined in the form of User Stories and Epics (groups of related user stories), and stored in the Product Backlog. The work is then organised in fortnightly periods called Sprints. Before a new sprint starts, the Product Owner (the voice of the customer) clearly specifies and estimates top priorities which are then organised in tasks and completed within the sprint. By following this method, both sides ensure that there is a potentially shippable product increment after every sprint.</p>

                    <p class="tm-default-p tm-nomargin tm-text-line-15">An intensive, one to two full-day discovery workshop is organised to help our team better grasp the core components of the business and gain knowledge. Usually the UX designer, project manager and the lead developer attend discovery workshops, but all team members can be included as well. This workshop can be held in our offices in Serbia, in your office, or via Skype call. The goal is to go through individual requirements, discussing and finalising the details. This process will capture user stories and journeys, user data and interactions and is essential to ensure a fool-proof implementation.</p>
