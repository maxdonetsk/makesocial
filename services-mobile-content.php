            <p>Let's talk tech. What do we recommend?</p>
            <p class="tm-increased tm-colored"><strong>There are two types of mobile apps: Native and Hybrid</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Native apps</strong> live on the device and are accessed through icons on the device home screen. They are installed through an app store (such as Google Play or Apple’s App Store). When developed for a specific platform, Android or iOs, they can take full advantage of all the device’s features: camera, GPS, microphone, list of contacts, etc. Native apps can use the device’s notification system and can work offline.</p>
            <p>As an alternative to native mobile apps, we can build hybrid mobile apps which is more cost effective but with slightly lower performance when compared to native apps.</p>
            <p><strong>Hybrid applications</strong> are part native apps, part web apps. They are web applications (or web pages) in the native browser, such as UIWebView or WKWebView in iOS and WebView in Android. Hybrid apps are developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and then wrapped in a native application. Hybrid mobile applications can employ a mobile device's native features. When built well, these apps look and feel like fully native apps but since they depend on the native browser, they are not as fast as native apps.</p>
            <p>The hybrid app development is faster, simpler, more rapid and the application is easier to maintain.</p>
